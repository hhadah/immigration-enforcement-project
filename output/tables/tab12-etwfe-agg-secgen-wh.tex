\item[1] \footnotesize{Each column is the results of the aggregat effects of extended two-way fixed effects estimation. 
                      Standard errors are clustered on the county level.}
\item[2] \footnotesize{The samples include second-generation Hispanic children ages 17 and below who live in intact families and the father is native born and mother is born in a Spanish-speaking country. 
                      A second-generation Hispanic child is one that is born in the United States with at least one parent born in a Spanish-speaking country.}
